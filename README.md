# Keyboard by KBB

## Summary
We are making this keyboard for self improvement and fun. The 65% mechanical keyboard has it's original PCB design, case and plate model.

## To open the shematics and PCB design
The PCB design was created in KiCad, so you can open it in the `keyboard/` folder.

## To run the code
You only need to upload the code once using Arduino IDE.

Keep in mind, that first the Atmega32u4 will need a bootloader, witch is programmed trough the bootloader pins. We had to program it with an Esp32-C3-mini, witches Arduino ISA codes I will upload here under the folder `Esp32-ISA`.

## Dependencies
Place the dependencies into the lib folder.
